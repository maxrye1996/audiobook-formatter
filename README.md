## Some scripts i use to improve Audiobook library for AudioBookShelf

## audiobook_formatter.py:
1) Joins chapters of book into one file
2) Deletes empty dirs
3) Deletes anything that isnt an mp3, m4b, m4a
4) finishes with a book structure of:
```
YOUR_AUDIOBOOK_DIR/Author1/Book1/Book1.mp3

YOUR_AUDIOBOOK_DIR/Author1/Book2/Book2.m4b

YOUR_AUDIOBOOK_DIR/Author2/Book1/Book1.m4a
```


## tidy_authors.py:
- prints authors with similar names (e.g JRR Tolkein and J.R.R Tolkein)
